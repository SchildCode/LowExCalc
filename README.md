# LowExCalc
- This is a Microsoft Excel workbook with Visual Basic for Applications macros.
- Use it to design low-exergy heating/cooling by means of embedded electric cables or hydronic pipes in floors, walls or ceilings. It predicts both thermal comfort and energy-efficiency performance. It draws a cross-section of the sustem, showing materials and calculated temperatures. 
- You can test different geometries and materials (from the three libraries for materials, tubes/cables, or surface convection). You can also add new products to the libraries.
- It applies, and improves upon, NordTest and CEN calculation methods. The main imporovements encompass more accurate treatment of the  thermal resistance between pipes/cables and the surrounding materials, and correct treatment of temperature distribution in hydronic systems in particular (log mean temperature difference and exit water temperature). The heat emission and 2D temperature distribution has been validated by comparison with detailed 2D FEM (finile element method) software.
